 * @section Overview
 * This is the common application programming interface (API) that defines
 * numerous functionality shared by all technology evaluations (TEs) under the
 * National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)'s Friction Ridge Image
 * and Features (%FRIF) umbrella. Refer to the evaluation-specific %FRIF API for
 * more detailed information on wrapping algorithm code for testing under a
 * NIST %FRIF TE.
 *
 * @section Technology Evaluations
 * The %FRIF TE umbrella covers the following friction ridge algorithm tests:
 *  - @ref e1n "Exemplar 1:N Search"
 *  - Mark 1:N Search --- _Coming Soon!_
 *  - 1:1 Comparison --- _Coming Soon!_
 *  - PIV 1:1 Comparison --- _Coming Soon!_
 *  - Slap Fingerprint Segmentation --- _Coming Soon!_
 *
 * @section Contact
 * Additional information regarding %FRIF can be received by emailing questions
 * to the test liaisons at frif@nist.gov.
