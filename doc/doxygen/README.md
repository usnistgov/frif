Doxygen
-------
The documentation on https://pages.nist.gov/frifte/doc/api is generated
automatically from inline source comments with [Doxygen](http://doxygen.nl).
You may build this yourself in other formats using the Doxygen configuration
file `frifte-api.conf` in this directory using this command:

```bash
doxygen frifte-api.conf
```

By default, only the HTML version is built, which will be output into a
directory named `html`.
